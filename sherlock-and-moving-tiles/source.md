# Sherlock and Moving Tiles

This problem was posted by [darkshadows][author] on [HackerRank][source].

## Problem
Two congruent sqaures are placed such that their bottom left corners coincide with the origin of the Cartesian plane and their sides are paralled to the axis.

At time $$t=0$$ both squares start moving along line $$y=x$$ with velocites $$S_1$$ and $$S_2$$. Let $$A$$ represent the area of the intersection between the two squares at any given time.

We need to solve for $$t$$ given $$A$$. We can assume all distances are in meters, time is in seconds and velocities are in meters per second.

## Constraints
$$S_1,S_2>0$$
$${S_1}\neq{S_2}$$
$${1}\leq{A}\leq{L^2}$$

## Solution
